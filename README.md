# Pathfinding-Algorithms
Seems like every CS student has to do this project someday. I added a few algorithms that I can't find in this kind of projects to make it at least different from the rest :man_shrugging:. 

#### Usage

First two squares are the source :orange_square: and the end square :blue_square:, after that everything is barrier (gray square). Draw with left mouse button, erase with right mouse button.
